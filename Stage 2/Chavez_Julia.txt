For stage 2 of our project the following paragraph explains how I've personally contributed to the project. First I have worked on brainstorming how to organize the veterinary clinic info into different classes. My brainstorming basically created a tree map to show how each of our components worked together and then my group used that info to create a flow map as well adding info they saw fit. I then used the single responsibility principle to understand the methods necessary for each class. In doing this I was able to create a template for us to follow when looking to create the class diagram for the Provider. I then drew up an idea of what I thought the Provider class should look like and shared that with my group. From there a group member created a google docs and entered this info on there. After that I started to work on a digram for the client class. I chose the instance variables based off what I new I needed to be accessed in multiple methods. From there I once again used the single responsibility principle to decide what methods worked for this class. I also ensured to tie in the two classes together by calling the Provider class in a couple of methods as parameters. That is all I contributed to the actual UML diagram itself and as far as the GitHub I created the Stage 2 folder, as well as adding the UML Diagram PDF and my personal .txt file in the stage 2 folder. Overall, I believe we have a good structure to start our programming but would also appreciate all feedback to improve our UML diagrams.
