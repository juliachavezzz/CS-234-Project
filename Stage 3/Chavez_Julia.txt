For stage 3 of our project I have contributed heavily to the UML diagram updates, the code itself, and the Instruction guide for the user. For the UML diagram, I made adjustments and changed the diagram based on the feedback that was given to us after stage 2 of our project. I created the different classes and methods that were in the UML diagram that was used to start coding. From there I used the UML diagram to create the code for the different classes and the different methods. I did need to make slight changes to the UML diagram based off the issues I ran into during coding but overall the original UML diagram was beneficial when it came to the coding portion. Once I finished with the separate classes of code, I then moved on to working on the main code. This is where a majority of my work went into as I created the code to display the main menu, the separate menus based on the option chosen from the main menu, and the code to perform specific operations once a specific options is chosen from the secondary menu. I also created the code for the the preloaded information. In this step I ended up with a lot of code and feel like I could have organized it better if I had realized how much code it was going to be from the start. Overall though I was able to achieve a working system after many test runs and corrections. I then let my partner work on updating the UML diagram based on the final code as well as create the readme.txt file for this stage. I then worked on creating an instruction guide for the user and used previous examples to format our instruction guide as well.
